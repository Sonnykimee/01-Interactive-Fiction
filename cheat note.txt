To give better gameplay for Mr. Francis, I wrote this note.
When you first start, you will be moved to another world.
The first thing you will see is a grass field and an old lady in hunger.
She is actually a disguise of Ianne the Goddess of Compassion.

type "goto 0" to approach to the old lady.

Now if you type "people", you will see the list of people you can talk.

type "talk oldlady".

If you type "inv". You can see what's in your inventory. You have a bag of nacho chips.

type "give 0", to give the chips to the old lady.

Ianne undisguises, she salutes you for your compassionate behavior. She will give you a golden whistle.

If you go to the village and find Gypsy woman in the market place, you can show the golden whistle by giving it to her. She will give it back.

If you evenutally go to the shrine of compassion, you will see Mryce the druid. Give her the golden whistle.

This is an example of RPG-like quest that I have thought about.
